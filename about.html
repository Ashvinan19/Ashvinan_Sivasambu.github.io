                    <p>Hi, My name is Ashvinan Sivasambu and  I'm a student studying Computer Science, at Wilfrid Laurier University and im from Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Im currently looking for a summer 2024 internship, and I'm super excited to dive into the world of technology and innovation.

                        My experience in Computer Science at Wilfrid Laurier University has been incredibly rewarding and thrilling. As I move forward into my year I'm also actively involved in applying what I've learned to projects and collaborations.
                        
                        During my journey I had the opportunity to work as an Office Assistant at the City of Ottawa where I honed my administrative skills. It was a chance for me to learn about how city administration works while also improving my abilities.
                        
                        On campus you'll find me actively involved in clubs like the Hindu Student Council Club and the First Year Project. Additionally I participate in clubs like Echohawks, the Food Bank and Shinerama. Back, in school I was part of both the Prom Committee and Athletic Student Council which helped develop my teamwork skills and leadership qualities.
                        
                        With my expertise, in programming languages like Python, Java and C I thoroughly enjoy tackling problems and finding solutions. Additionally I have an understanding of data structures, algorithms, database management and software development.
                        
                        I am genuinely curious and enthusiastic about technology. I have a drive to continuously learn and grow in the field of computer science.
                        
                        I would be thrilled to explore opportunities collaborate on projects or simply stay connected and continue learning. Please feel free to reach out for networking engaging discussions or even casual conversations, about the evolving world of technology!</p>
