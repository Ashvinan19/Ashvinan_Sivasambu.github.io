This is my personal portfolio, I did not make real time updates so i will give a brief overfiew

I used htll5up for my format for my website and personalized it for me
some of the following issues i ran into while writing this is:
- STILL not able to make my resume link open through github pages, even though they are able to open through vscode
-  making new sections in the page became difficult do to the technological struggles i face

overall this has been pretty fun I learned a lot about how to make a personal website and I am excited for the future of filling it up with all my projects!
